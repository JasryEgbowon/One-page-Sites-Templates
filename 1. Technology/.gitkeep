Yo! That's a fantastic project. Creating a set of template portfolios is a smart move by your boss. It's all about covering a wide range of aesthetics and functional needs.

First, let's break down the core structure that every one-page website will need. This is our blueprint:

Hero Section: A killer first impression. Big headline, sub-headline, and a strong Call-to-Action (CTA) button.

Services/Offerings: What the company actually does. Break it down into digestible chunks.

About/Why Us: A short blurb about their mission, values, or what makes them unique.

Portfolio/Work/Results: The evidence. Showcases past projects, client results, or products.

Testimonials: Social proof to build trust.

Team (Optional): For companies where the people are a key selling point.

Contact Section: A simple form, email, phone number, and maybe a map.

Now, let's get into the 10 ideas. The key is to differentiate them by sector, vibe, and primary goal.

How to Put This Down & Present It to Your Boss
Don't just give him a list. Create a Template Catalog.

Create a Mood Board for Each: For each of the 10 ideas, gather 2-3 reference images (from sites like Dribbble, Awwwards, or real companies) that capture the vibe.

Define the Unique Selling Proposition (USP): Write one sentence for each template. For example:

SaaS Template: "Designed to convert visitors into free trial users with a clear value proposition."

Fashion Template: "Focuses on visual storytelling and product showcasing to drive sales."

Map the User Journey: Briefly note the path you want a visitor to take on each site. For the Fitness Coach, it's: See Hero -> Get Motivated -> Browse Programs -> Read Success Stories -> Book a Session.

This shows you're thinking strategically, not just making pretty designs. Once you have this high-level plan approved, then you can move to picking a tech stack (e.g., HTML/CSS/JS, a static site generator, etc.) and start coding.

This is a solid foundation. Want to dive deeper into the specific layout for one of these?
